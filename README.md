# Froggy-Game

This is a simple game I programmed with the Scratch block-based visual programming language.
The aim of the game is to navigate an avatar to get a ball while avoiding four frogs that criss cross the screen.
The ball disappears once the avatar touches, your score increases by 1, and the ball reappears in a different random location.
When your score reaches 10, you win the game.
When your avatar touches any of the frogs, you lose the game.
Background music is included.
