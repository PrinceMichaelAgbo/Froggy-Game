##Froggy Ball Game.
This is a simple game I programmed with the Scratch block-based visual programming language.
The aim of the game is to navigate an avatar, using the direction keys, to get a ball while avoiding four frogs that criss cross the screen.
The ball disappears once the avatar touches/gets the ball, your score increases by 1, and the ball reappears in a different random location.
When your score reaches 10, you win the game.
When your avatar touches any of the frogs, you lose the game.
Background music is included.

##Penalty Shootout.
This is a simple game I programmed with the Scratch block-based visual programming language.
The aim of the game is to score as many goals as possible in a penalty shootout before 1 minute.
Pressing the t button aims for the top while pressing the b button aims for the bottom.
The goalkeeper randomly decided what direction to go to and if that coincides with the direction of the ball, the goalkeeper catches the ball everytime.
Hence, it is always a 50% chance of scoring.
When 1 minute is up, the game ends.
Background music is included.
